Understand the Job Description deeply:

Extract role title, key responsibilities, must-have skills, nice-to-have skills, required experience, tools, education, and soft skills.

Analyze the Resume thoroughly:

Perform a Smart Comparison:

Match the candidate's resume with JD criteria.

Identify missing skills or gaps in experience.

Highlight key strengths that align well with the JD.

Evaluate skill depth vs. breadth, not just keyword overlap.
